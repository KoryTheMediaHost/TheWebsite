<p>This is a webpage based game, made by someone with very little coding experience.</p>
<br>
<p>it is reccommended you keep your window in fullscreen for the best user experience,
as i did not design this with sticky css.</p>
<br>
<p>THERE IS NO SAVING IN THIS, IF YOU LEAVE THIS, THE SEQUENCE WILL LIKELY START OVER.</p>
<br>
<p>most of all I do hope you enjoy this "game"</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>You are now ready to <a href="lockscreen.html">play</a></p>
